Simple storage contract.

This is my very first Solidity smart contract.  

It demonstrates how to Store a favorite number on the blockchain, Retrieve the stored number, Add people with their names and favorite numbers, Look up favorite numbers by name  

It uses a simple uint256 variable for storage, struct to group name and favoriteNumber, includes an array of people, includes a mapping (name â†’ favoriteNumber) for quick lookup  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The contract has been deployed successfully on the Sepolia Testnet.  
Contract Address: (0xc6D3D40e6E35cfDd5C461A258dB78A1D9d05b068)  
You can view it and interact with it on Etherscan.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was built as a first practice contract in Solidity.  
Deployment was done using Remix IDE and MetaMask.
