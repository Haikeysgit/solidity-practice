PhoneBook Contract  

The PhoneBook contract is a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates how to use structs, arrays, and mappings.  

It allows storing a list of contacts with their name and phone number.  

Contacts can be added by calling the addContact function.  

The contract uses mappings to make it possible to look up a phone number by providing a name, or look up a name by providing a phone number.  

This project is part of my Solidity learning practice, following SimpleStorage.
